<+s>: The BlueJ editor was relatively easy to navigate.
      Finding the conversion factors required to solve the problems was relatively easy.

In the future: It would be nice to take user input as the starting unit (miles in miles to kilometers, 
               etc)instead of just some arbitrary, declared value.
