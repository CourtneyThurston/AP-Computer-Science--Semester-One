**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments (and additional test data) as 
      needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first, and I had to debug a few compiler errors 
      such as "incompatible types". I also had trouble using strings for the user input, so I ended up
      working with variables instead since the rubric did not specify which had to be used (thus the
      selections are 1, 2, 3, and 4, rather than F, C, i, and c).
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to grow this program to support other functionalities! I would also like
               to solve the string issue detailed above.
