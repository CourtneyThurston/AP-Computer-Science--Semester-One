<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments throughout.
   
      
<-s>: This particular assignment was relatively easy to complete--with the exception of
      figuring out how to format the output--and it was fun to learn about array lists!

In the future: I would like to continue with object oriented programming and array lists!
