**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with the help of the escape sequence \n.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first, but once I knew 
      how to use the escape sequences efficiently, development ran a lot smoother.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to continue using escape sequences! I would also like to find software
               that enables you to make ASCII art of movies quickly and such.
