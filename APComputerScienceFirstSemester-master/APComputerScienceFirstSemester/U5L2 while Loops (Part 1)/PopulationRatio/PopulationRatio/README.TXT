**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: Oddly enough, the final output never shows when the second to last System.out.print() commands
      aren't commented out--so I commented them out!

In the future: I would like to figure out the <-s> issue.
