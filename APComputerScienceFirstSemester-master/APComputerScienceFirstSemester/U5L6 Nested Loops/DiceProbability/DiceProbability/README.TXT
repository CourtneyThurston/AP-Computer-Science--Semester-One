<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: I had to look up some nested loops advice on Stack Overflow. Luckily, resources explaining how to
      properly construct nested loops already existed, so that made it easy to find help with that 
      concept online.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to consider ways in which I could make this program more interesting.

<+q> What is the effect on the percentages when the number of rolls is increased?
The percentages appear to even out, as opposed to a few potential sums having a very high probability.
