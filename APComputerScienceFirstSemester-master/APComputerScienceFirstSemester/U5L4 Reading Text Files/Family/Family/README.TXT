**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: I had to debug an error where the file was not being read. Once I realized I needed to move
      the text file into the folder, the rest of development ran smoothly.

In the future: I would like to consider ways in which I could make this program more efficient!
