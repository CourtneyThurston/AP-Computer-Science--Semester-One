<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first, and I had to debug a few compiler errors 
      such as "incompatible types". The loop structure also initially threw me off, but once I
      figured out how to do one, all the rest fell into place and development ran smoothly again.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to grow this program to support other functionalities! Generators are quite
               fun. Perhaps a username generator based on words!
