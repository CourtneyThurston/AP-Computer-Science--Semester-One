**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first, and I had to debug a few compiler errors 
      such as "incompatible types". Once I figured out how to use two conditions, development ran
      smoothly again.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to use more booleans and conditionals!
