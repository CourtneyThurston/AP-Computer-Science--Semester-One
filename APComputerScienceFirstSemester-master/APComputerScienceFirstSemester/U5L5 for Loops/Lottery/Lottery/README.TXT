**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: I didn't experience many issues at all with these two classes--I tend to think algorithmically, 
      so the challenge program wasn't as difficult as I anticipated!
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to consider ways in which I could make this program more entertaining
               and user-friendly.
