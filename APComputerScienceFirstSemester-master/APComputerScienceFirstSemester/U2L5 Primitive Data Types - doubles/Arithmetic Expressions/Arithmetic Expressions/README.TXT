<+s>: The BlueJ editor was relatively easy to navigate.
      I was already familiar with print syntax, so those were rather simple as well.

      
<-s>: Fixing the spacing and lining the lines up took a lot of time.
      I made frequent typos and messed up the int syntax (placing values first).
      I also wish I knew of a more efficient way of declaring integers and doubles rather than
      just one at a time.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would really like to find a more efficient IDE. BlueJ was
slightly tedious--albeit not too challenging-- to use.
