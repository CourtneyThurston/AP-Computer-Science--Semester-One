**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first... once I knew what I was doing, development
      ran a lot smoother. There was a lot of debugging and research required to complete this program.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to make this program more efficient using methods I learn in this course in the future.
