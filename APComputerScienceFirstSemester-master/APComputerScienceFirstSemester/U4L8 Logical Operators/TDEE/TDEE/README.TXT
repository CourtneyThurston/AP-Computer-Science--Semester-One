**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments where needed throughout.
   
      
<-s>: I had to debug an issue I was having with .nextLine(), and I eventually changed it to .next()
      to ensure that it wasn't counting the \n from the line before as input and thus skipping the
      gender prompt. Once this was fixed, the rest of development ran smoothly.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to automatically re-run the program somehow after the user enters
               an invalid response.
