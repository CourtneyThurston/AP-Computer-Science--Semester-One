**************************** P M R *********************************************
 
<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized rather cleanly.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first... once I knew what I was doing, development
      ran a lot smoother.
           
*******************************************************************************
In the future: I would like to make this program more efficient and even less cluttered by using arrays and loops.
