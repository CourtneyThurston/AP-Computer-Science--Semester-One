<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some comments throughout.
   
      
<-s>: It was difficult to organize the program at first, and I had to debug a few compiler errors 
      such as "incompatible types". Once I figured out how to use two conditions, development ran
      smoothly again.
