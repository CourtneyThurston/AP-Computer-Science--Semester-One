<+s>: The program works as intended, and is organized cleanly with some explanatory comments throughout.
   
      
<-s>: Because of how I decided to structure the program, I had to go learn a lot more about referencing inner
      classes before I could proceed. That took me quite some time, but eventually I realized what I had to do
      to get the code in both classes to compile.

In the future: I would like to continue with object oriented programming!
